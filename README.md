# CV_isfun

Do not know much about what this project is, but something about a clock.

## Clock (LLM perspective)
It's like a plane propeller with numbers around it, people can somehow tell you the time by looking at it. 

# To do:
- [x] Task 2-1
- [X] Task 2-2
- [ ] Task 2-3
  - [X]  Get time of every frame without crashing :)
  - [X]  Export time of each frame to .csv file
  - [X]  Troubleshoot sudden minute or hour changes (add memory ?)
  - [ ]  Fix random seconds pointer jumps
