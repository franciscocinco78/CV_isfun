# Project Instructions

This project contains scripts organized by tasks. Each task involves specific files, and to run them, you need to update the file paths for the images or videos as described below.

---

## Task 1

**Files:**
- `script.py` 
- `task2-1.py`

### Instructions
1. Open `script.py`.
   - Locate the variable `image_path` at **line 5**.
   - Update `image_path` with the appropriate image file path.
2. Open `task2-1.py`.
   - Locate the variable `image_path` at **line 4**.
   - Update `image_path` with the appropriate image file path.

## Task 2

**Files:**
- `script_2.py`
- `task2-2.py`

### Instructions
1. Open `script_2.py`.
   - Locate the variable `image_path` at **line 7**.
   - Update `image_path` with the appropriate image file path.
2. Open `task2-2.py`.
   - Locate the variable `image_path` at **line 23**.
   - Update `image_path` with the appropriate image file path.

## Task 3

**File:**
- `task2-3.py`

### Instructions
1. Open `task2-3.py`.
   - Locate the variable `video_path` at **line 621**.
   - Update `video_path` with the appropriate video file path.

## Verification

After updating the file paths, verify the script functionality with the **output_validator.py** script:

1. Open `output_validator.py`.
2. Locate the CSV file path variable (if specified) and update it with the correct file path.
3. Run `output_validator.py` to check the output.

This validation script will detect any inconsistencies or jumps in hours, minutes, and seconds within the data, confirming that your updates are functioning as expected. 

Make sure to save the changes to each file after updating the paths.
